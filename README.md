# Advanced-Encryption-Algorithm-AES-Project

To complete this assignment our team worked through the following steps in order to analyze and solve the problem of implementing AES (256 bit) in Python.

1. Analyze provided Python AES algorithm to identify missing functions.
2. Write functions necessary to implement AES algorithm.
3. Integrating new functions into existing code base.
4. Debug and test the integrated code.
5. Verify if solution correctly implements AES algorithm
